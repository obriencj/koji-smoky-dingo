====================

.. parsed-literal::

 usage: koji latest-archives [-h] [--json] [--urls]
                             [--build-type TYPE | --rpm | --maven | --image | --win]
                             [--archive-type EXT] [--key KEY] [--unsigned]
                             [--noinherit]
                             TAGNAME

 List latest archives from a tag

 positional arguments:
   TAGNAME               The tag containing the archives

 optional arguments:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --json                Output archive information as JSON
   --urls, -U            Present archives as URLs using the configured topurl.
                         Default: use the configured topdir
   --noinherit           Do not follow inheritance

 Build Filtering Options:
   --build-type TYPE     Only show archives for the given build type. Example
                         types are rpm, maven, image, win. Default: show all
                         archives.
   --rpm                 --build-type=rpm
   --maven               --build-type=maven
   --image               --build-type=image
   --win                 --build-type=win

 Archive Filtering Options:
   --archive-type EXT, -a EXT
                         Only show archives with the given archive type. Can be
                         specified multiple times. Default: show all

 RPM Options:
   --key KEY, -k KEY     Only show RPMs signed with the given key. Can be
                         specified multiple times to indicate any of the keys
                         is valid. Preferrence is in order defined. Default:
                         show unsigned RPMs
   --unsigned            Allow unsigned copies if no signed copies are found
                         when --key=KEY is specified. Otherwise if keys are
                         specified, then only RPMs signed with one of those
                         keys are shown.


This command retrieves a list of archives and RPMs from the latest
builds of a tag and displays their full paths.

The classification of what is "latest" varies slightly for builds with
the maven BType, as they are expected to include multiple versions of
the same group and artifact depending on the tag's settings.

The paths are based on the koji client configuration for the profile
in use, and so will start with the ``topdir`` value. If ``--urls`` is
specified, then the ``topurl`` value is used instead.


RPM Signatures
--------------

This command offers the ability to refer to the signed copy of any
RPMs discovered. By setting the ``--key`` option to a signature
fingerprint, then only RPMs which have been signed with that key will
be presented. A series of keys can be given by specifying the option
multiple times, which will be used as an order-of-preference list of
signatures. If falling back to an unsigned copy is desireable in
situations where none of the preferred signatures have been used, then
the ``--unsigned`` option can be specified.

Note that koji will report that RPMs have been signed, but may choose
to optimize volume storage by deleting the full signed copy of the
RPM. In this case, the path as reported may not actually exist. In
this event, it's possible to use the ``koji write-signed-rpm``
command to request that the signed copy is written out to disk again
based on the cached signature headers.

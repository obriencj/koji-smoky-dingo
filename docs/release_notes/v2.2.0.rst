Koji Smoky Dingo 2.2.0 Release Notes
====================================

*Unreleased*

Version 2.2.0 continues compatability from 2.1.0, with some additional
features as noted below


Commands
--------

* Updated the ``userinfo`` command to use an anonymous-compatible
  group membership query. Previously the ``getGroupMembers`` call was
  being used, which always failed because it required the admin
  permission and the command was anonymous. New implementation uses
  ``queryHistory``
* Support for future koji 1.35 which has anonymous ``getGroupMembers``
  and ``getUserGroups`` calls
* Added group membership information to the ``userinfo`` command.


API
---

* introduced a new `kojismokydingo.users.get_group_members` function
* fixed some missing ``__all__`` exports in `kojismokydingo.types`


Bugfix
------

* added missing caret support to `kojismokydingo.rpm.evr_compare`


Other
-----

* moved documentation build into a github action workflow, removing
  gh-pages submodule and related Makefile targets
* migrated away from the ``build_sphinx`` setuptools command

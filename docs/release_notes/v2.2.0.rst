Koji Smoky Dingo 2.2.0 Release Notes
====================================

*Unreleased*

Version 2.2.0 continues compatability from 2.1.1, with some additional
features as noted below


Commands
--------

* Updated the ``userinfo`` command to use an anonymous-compatible
  group membership query. Previously the ``getGroupMembers`` call was
  being used, which always failed because it required the admin
  permission and the command was anonymous. New implementation uses
  ``queryHistory``
* Support for future koji 1.35 which has anonymous ``getGroupMembers``
  and ``getUserGroups`` calls
* Added group membership information to the ``userinfo`` command.


API
---

* introduced a new `kojismokydingo.users.get_group_members` function
* introduced a new `kojismokydingo.users.get_user_groups` function
* fixed some missing ``__all__`` exports in `kojismokydingo.types`
* the `kojismokydingo.hub_version` function will work with the new
  `koji.hub_version_str` property, which is populated from a new value
  in http headers on responses from the hub. This potentially saves us
  the explicit ``getKojiVersion`` call on newer deployments


Meta Plugin
-----------

* exceptions loading entry points in the meta plugin will no longer be
  printed to stderr by default
* added checking for `KSD_VERBOSE=1` environment variable, which turns
  on printing of any exceptions during entry point loading
* added checking for `KSD_EXPLODE=1` environment variable, which will
  cause the first exception during entry point loading to be fully
  raised


Bugfix
------

* added missing caret support to `kojismokydingo.rpm.evr_compare`


Other
-----

* moved documentation build into a github action workflow, removing
  gh-pages submodule and related Makefile targets
* migrated away from the ``build_sphinx`` setuptools command
* introduced nightly CI that runs against the upstream git version of
  koji, in order to catch any additional API changes early on
* added more static analysis checking and a special proxytype plugin,
  and moved from the ``stubs`` directory to the ``mypy`` directory

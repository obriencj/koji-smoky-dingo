Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.6 Release Notes
============================================

*Unreleased*

General user-base is still very limited at this point in time, so we
get very few bug reports or new ideas. If you're a koji-smoky-dingo
user and you have feedback, please do let me know via the
[tracker]. We need as many users as possible to try things out so that
we can identify problems before a 1.0.0 release!

Otherwise, still chugging along!

- Refactored the sifty sieve caching mechanism so that it is easier to
  associate cached calls with the sifter rather than the sieve
  instance.
- Added a ChacheMixin to kojismokydingo.sift.common with methods that
  will cache the results of large tag queries. Sieve classes can
  inherit this to make use of the cache.
- Added two new build sieves: compare-latest-nvr and
  compare-latest-id. These allow for filtering builds using comparison
  operators against the latest build of the same package in a given
  tag.
- Fixed an issue where the ksd-filter-builds standalone would still
  require the '--profile' option to be specified on the command-line
  even when the '#option --profile' directive was present in the
  filter.

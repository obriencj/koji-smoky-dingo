Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.7 Release Notes
============================================

*unreleased*

Still chugging along!

- removed AllGroupPkgs tag sieve in favor of the GroupPkgs sieve with a
  new ``require_all:`` option
- removed `Sifter._convert_sym_aliases` in favor of using the aliases field
  on the `LogicNot` and `Flagged` sieves
- the `Sieve.check` method is no longer abstract, and by default returns
  `False` (ie. no results are included). This allows Sieve subclasses to
  opt to override the `run` method without having to still include an
  otherwise useless `check` implementation as well.

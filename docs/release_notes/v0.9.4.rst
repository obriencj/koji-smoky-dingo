Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.4 Release Notes
============================================

*Unreleased*

Introducing a new mini language, Sifty Dingo

- you can now write filtering expressions for the list-components and
  filter-builds commands
- filter into multiple buckets at a time with a single set of rules

Chugging along and collecting feedback

- list-build-archives now accepts multiple NVRs
- list-build-archives and latest-archives now accept an '--arch'
  option which allows filtering by architecture
- rename the '--build-type' option for list-build-archives and
  latest-archives to simply '--type'
- add the build type option aliases to relevant build filtering
  commands
- move as_userinfo into the base package
- add int_or_str function to cli package, for use as the type argument
  to parser arguments. Will safely convert str to int if applicable.
  This allows a number of commands to accept the ID of their relevant
  data type in place of its name
- unique now accepts a 'key=' parameter to allow deduplication of
  otherwise unhashable values
- parse_datetime now accepts a 'strict=' parameter to let it return
  None instead of raising an Exception when parsing fails

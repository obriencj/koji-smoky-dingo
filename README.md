Koji Smoky Dingo is a collection of client command-line plugins for
the [Koji] build system, and a set of utility modules for writing your
own commands or scripts.

## Meta Plugin

This project provides a relatively tiny CLI plugin for koji, named
kojismokydingometa. The meta plugin acts as an adapter between koji's
existing CLI plugin loading framework and Python entry_points.

The meta plugin can be used to load additional commands beyond those
provided as part of this project. Simply register your commands with
the `"koji_smoky_dingo"` entry point key. See the [example command]
as a reference.

## Tag Commands

These commands modify tag features, requiring either the tag
permission (koji >= [1.18]) or the admin permission.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|`block-env-var` |Blocks a mock environment variable from a tag. |
|`block-rpm-macro` |Blocks a mock RPM macro from a tag. |
|`bulk—move-builds` |Move a large amount of builds, bypassing the creation of individual tasks. |
|`bulk—tag-builds` |Tag a large amount of builds, bypassing the creation of individual tasks. |
|`bulk—untag-builds` |Untag a large amount of builds, bypassing the creation of individual tasks. |
|`remove-env-var` |Removes a mock environment variable from a tag. |
|`remove-rpm-macro` |Removes a mock RPM macro from a tag. |
|`renum—tag-inheritance` |Adjust the priority values of a tag to maintain the same inheritance order, but to create an even amount of space between each entry. |
|`set-env-var` |Sets, unsets, or blocks the value of a mock environment variable on a tag. |
|`set-rpm-macro` |Sets, unsets, or blocks the value of a mock RPM macro on a tag. |
|`swap—tag-inheritance` |Adjust the inheritance of a tag by replacing one entry for another. If both entries are already parents of a tag, then swap the priority of the two. |

## Install

The kojismokydingo package utilizes setuptools and can be built and
installed as an egg or wheel.

Because of how koji loads client plugins, if you want the meta plugin
available by default system-wide, then the package needs to be
installed into the default site-packages for the python
installation.


### As an RPM via DNF

If using an RPM-based distribution, this is easily achieved using the
included spec to produce an RPM and install that.

```bash
make clean rpm
dnf install dist/noarch/python3-kojismokydingo-1.0.0-1.fc32.noarch.rpm
```


### As a System-wide Wheel via Pip

Using traditional setuptools or pip installation methods can also
achieve this by specifying the specific root or prefix parameter

```bash
# Python 2.7 global install
python2 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip2 install --prefix /usr -I dist/kojismokydingo-1.0.0-py2-none-any.whl

# Python 3 global install
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip3 install --prefix /usr -I dist/kojismokydingo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```


### As a User-only Wheel via Pip

However, if you only want the plugin available for yourself, you can
install it anywhere and tell koji to look in that particular
`site-package/koji_cli_plugins` instance

```bash
# Python 3 user install
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip3 install --user -I dist/kojismokydingo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

And the following setting in ~/.koji/config assuming Python version
3.7 -- read the output of the install command above to verify your
install path. Note that the section title needs to match your koji
profile, and that you need to configure this setting for each profile
you'll want to use the meta plugin with.

```
[koji]
plugin_paths = ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/koji_cli_plugins/
```

With koji >= [1.18], the meta plugin can also be symlinked into
`~/.koji/plugins`

[1.18]: https://docs.pagure.org/koji/release_notes/release_notes_1.18/

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.koji/plugins
ln -s ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/koji_cli_plugins/kojismokydingometa.py ~/.koji/plugins
```
